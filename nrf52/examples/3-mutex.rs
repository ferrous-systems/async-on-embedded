//! Mutex shared between tasks
//!
//! "When to use `Mutex` instead of a `RefCell`?" Both abstractions will give you an exclusive
//! (`&mut-`) reference to the data and that reference can survive across `yield`s (either explicit
//! , i.e. `task::yield`, or implicit, `.await`).
//!
//! The difference between the two is clear when contention occurs. If two or more tasks contend for
//! a `RefCell`, as in they both call `borrow_mut` on it, you'll get a panic. On the other hand, if
//! you use a `Mutex` in a similar scenario, i.e. both tasks call `lock` on it, then one of them
//! will "asynchronous" wait for (i.e. not resume until) the other task to release (releases) the
//! lock.
//!
//! Expected output:
//!
//! ```
//! B: before recv
//! A: before send
//! A: after send
//! A: yield
//! B: 42
//! DONE
//! ```
//!
//! Try to replace the `Mutex` with `RefCell` and re-run the example
